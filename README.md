## Mollie setup

InvoiceRush uses Mollie only to collect **SaaS subscription fees** from InvoiceRush users. Version one does **not** collect end-customer invoice payments.

### Test mode

1. Create a Mollie account and copy the **test** API key.
2. Set `MOLLIE_API_KEY=test_…`.
3. Expose localhost with ngrok/cloudflared and set `MOLLIE_WEBHOOK_URL` to `https://…/api/billing/webhook`.
4. Complete a Starter/Pro/Business checkout from `/app/subscription`.
5. Confirm webhook updates local subscription status (never trust the return URL alone).

### Live mode

1. Complete Mollie merchant onboarding.
2. Switch to the **live** API key only on the production environment.
3. Configure the live webhook URL.
4. Verify GBP payment methods are enabled.
5. Test upgrade, downgrade (next period), cancellation, and failed payment handling.

### Recurring flow implemented

1. Create/reuse Mollie customer  
2. First payment (`sequenceType: first`) → mandate  
3. Create subscription after valid mandate  
4. Idempotent webhook processing via `subscription_events`  
5. Cancel online from Subscription page  

Mollie approval is **not** guaranteed.

---

## Email (SPF / DKIM / DMARC)

1. Add your sending domain in Resend.
2. Publish SPF, DKIM, and DMARC DNS records as instructed by Resend.
3. Set `EMAIL_FROM` to a verified address (e.g. `InvoiceRush <noreply@dmrush.store>`).
4. Test verification, password reset, invoice/quote send, and billing emails.

Without `RESEND_API_KEY`, development logs emails and does **not** claim delivery.

---

## Scheduled jobs

Protect cron endpoints with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`.

| Job | Route |
|-----|-------|
| Recurring invoices | `POST /api/cron/recurring-invoices` |
| Payment reminders | `POST /api/cron/payment-reminders` |
| Subscription reconciliation | `POST /api/cron/subscription-reconciliation` |
| Email retries | `POST /api/cron/email-retries` |
| Data exports | `POST /api/cron/data-exports` |
| Account deletion | `POST /api/cron/account-deletion` |
| Cleanup tokens | `POST /api/cron/cleanup-tokens` |
| Cleanup temp uploads | `POST /api/cron/cleanup-temp-uploads` |

Configure your host’s scheduler (e.g. Vercel Cron, systemd timer, GitHub Actions) to call these hourly/daily as appropriate.

---

## Deployment

1. Provision PostgreSQL and run migrations.
2. Configure S3-compatible storage.
3. Set production env vars (live Mollie keys only in production).
4. Deploy the Next.js app with HTTPS on your real domain.
5. Point DNS, configure email authentication, and register Mollie webhooks.
6. Create a strong admin account; remove test accounts.
7. Enable backups and optional Sentry (`SENTRY_DSN`).
8. Run the launch checklist below.

### Rollback

1. Redeploy the previous known-good release.
2. If a migration is incompatible, restore the database from the latest backup before re-running the old app version.
3. Confirm Mollie webhook URL still points at a healthy endpoint.

### Backups

- Nightly automated PostgreSQL backups with point-in-time recovery where available.
- Periodic restore tests.
- Object storage versioning for logos/exports where supported.

## Production launch checklist

- [ ] Real production domain + HTTPS
- [ ] Live company information verified on site and in `src/config/brand.ts`
- [ ] Support inbox tested (`support@dmrush.store`)
- [ ] Legal pages reviewed by a UK solicitor
- [ ] Mollie live keys + webhook configured
- [ ] Live pricing verified (monthly/annual)
- [ ] Cancellation tested end-to-end
- [ ] Cookie consent behaviour verified
- [ ] Email SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass
- [ ] Database backups enabled and restore-tested
- [ ] Error monitoring configured
- [ ] Admin access secured; bootstrap password rotated
- [ ] Test accounts and test-mode labels removed from production
- [ ] No placeholder or “coming soon” content remains

---

## Security notes

- Workspace isolation on every tenant query
- Zod validation on mutations
- Rate limits on auth, contact, checkout, email, and public quotes
- Security headers via middleware (CSP, HSTS in production, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt; reset tokens hashed at rest
- Logo uploads restricted to PNG/JPEG/WebP
- Mollie secrets server-only; card data never stored by InvoiceRush

---

## Known limitations (honest)

- End-customer invoice **payment collection** is out of scope for v1 (manual payment records only).
- Reminder schedule UI is API-backed; refine workspace UI as needed.
- Resend delivery/bounce webhooks optional for richer email status.
- PDF logo embedding depends on stored logo assets being readable by the PDF generator.
- Full Playwright journey coverage beyond public smoke tests should be expanded before scale launch.
